# GUI Maker
- This is the official Github Repository for [GUI Maker](https://modrinth.com/datapack/gui-maker).
- All Work-in-Progress/Unstable Releases are uploaded here. Stable releases are uploaded on Modrinth!
- The datapack uses [GU Library](https://github.com/gibbsly/gu/tree/main) (embedded).

### What's Different?
- This re-written version of the datapack cleans out messy code, allows for easy readability and optimized execution/usage.
- The datapack was rewritten to introduce a foundation to create special items, some of which are: Toggle Buttons and Item Holder
- The datapack now also has a cache system, to save changes to every player's particular cache stack. (Hence the use of [GU](https://github.com/gibbsly/gu/tree/main))
